## avoiding server side setTimeouts

To keep the server from having to maintain too much about the game an easy
solution is to have each client randomly request a new tile - let them
do the hard work and let the server simply agree or disagree

## game 'tick'

Very different to socket2m - no actual client side game loop, so no 'tick' method
as such. Much more reliance on timeouts, intervals and events.
