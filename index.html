    <h1>Gridlock: Dev Journal</h1>
    <h3>Saturday 5th May, 2012 (#2)</h2>

    <p><b>Update</b>: Twitter's <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/anywhere/welcome">Anywhere</a>
    stuff is actually a lot better than I'd given it credit for. Given that the entire game is reliant
    on JS and there are no real page loads, the JS only twitter auth route is perfectly acceptable.</p>

    <p>Current mechanism is very simple - use the standard Twitter Anywhere JS handlers and emit
    a message to the server upon successful auth, or if user's already authed. Server simply
    checks if this user exists in the DB or not, creates it if so, and returns pretty much the same
    data back to the user after setting the user against the socket.</p>

    <p><b>TODO</b> need to verify the _identity attribute as per twitter's recommendations</p>

    <h2>Saturday 5th May, 2012 (#1)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Reworked directory structure to get rid of pointless server/app/ namespace</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Need to start looking at Twitter Oauth. Anxious about how this is going to work for a number
    of reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>None of the node oauth modules I've used before have worked very well - user has always been
        asked to re-auth the app every time</li>
        <li>It doesn't fit into the flow of the rest of the site - URLs instead of WebSockets etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Current plan is to try and do it all in a JS popup (can't do ajax / iframe because of Twitter's
    restrictions around that). Hopefully we can auth then call a JS method in the parent which will
    trigger a WebSockets message to the server to get the authed details. Might look at Twitter's own
    JS auth stuff too.</p>

    <h2>Friday 4th May, 2012</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>First real effort to get concept of proper game and tile models in</li>
        <li>Games now created properly, messages are restricted to the correct game room</li>
        <li>Users can now choose whether to create a new game or join existing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Moved pretty much all tile flipping logic to the server. Theory had been to let clients
    run their own game logic and have the server ratify any requests (e.g. is it time for another tile?)
    but this simply won't work in reality. The appeal is obvious - let the server detach itself from
    'game loop' style events as far as possible, but it doesn't scale well when dealing with more than
    2 player games - in a 10+ player scenario you'll end up with 10 different clients running their own
    version of events and just bombarding the server anyway.</p>
    
    <p>Turns out that moving the tile flip logic isn't so bad anyway. The relevant setTimeout calls are 
    all nicely abstracted behind the Game and tile models, meaning they're properly self contained and
    at least don't <i>look</i> ugly in the main server logic.</p>

    <p>Started using <a href="http://mongoosejs.com/">mongoose</a> for Model &rarr; MongoDB persistence.
    Seems decent but not quite sure I'm using it particularly well - my models need to do a lot of work
    which never has to go near the DB (create tiles, manage tile flips, tile hits etc), so at the moment
    each model simply has a namespaced 'model' property which is its mongoose object. Doesn't feel great.</p>

    <p>One thing I'm still unsure how to do correctly in node-land is sharing in-memory objects between
    controllers. Both the Game and Lobby controllers need to know about the list of active games, which
    is crudely held in an 'activeGames' object inside a StateManager object. This object feels like a bit
    of a catch all / global cop out, but not sure how else to solve that yet.</p>
