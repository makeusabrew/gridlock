    <h1>Gridlock: Dev Journal</h1>
    <p>This page contains musings, plans and general stuff <a href="http://twitter.com/makeusabrew">I've discovered</a>
    when building my latest multiplayer HTML5 game, <a href="http://github.com/makeusabrew/gridlock">Gridlock</a>.</p>

    <h2>Tuesday 8th May, 2012</h2>

    <p>Suddenly became conscious of the fact that for as long as the server runs, we're going to be dealing with
    shared objects in shared memory. This means that it's not as simple as keeping a 'points' variable against
    an in-memory user because that user might well be playing multiple games at once&mdash;which would make a complete
    mess. However, it is still correct that a socket should only map to one user, since two tabs (and two games) authed
    as one user is still, well, one user.</p>

    <p>Need to think of a neat way of ensuring data integrity across multiple games without just resorting to huge
    hash maps like <code>Game.userPoints[user_id] = 123</code>. In the particular case of points/score, we additionally
    also do need a 'global' score to keep track of a player's points across all games they've ever played.</p>

    <p>Replaced all server side 'socket' objects with a wrapper class: SuperSocket. Motiviation is twofold:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Didn't like callback style socket.set() and socket.get just to set in-memory socket properties</li>
        <li>Allows pre-dispatch logic to be built in, e.g. only allow route foo:bar:baz to fire if socket.game exists etc</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Haven't started work on the second point yet but already having synchronous setters/getters makes code a lot more readable. I'm sure
    there was nothing to stop me simply setting new properties on socketio's sockets, but it would have felt wrong to violate their set / get
    conventions in place.</p>

    <p>Started to think about chat mechanism tonight too. Ideally want to have a system whereby a user always
    has a chat pane which seamlessly switches between lobby &rarr; game &rarr; lobby, possibly also allowing an
    in game user to receive and interact with lobby chat messages too. Each state is currently completely isolated
    so providing interstate (!?) consistency here could be interesting. It also breaks the so far one-to-one mapping
    between client &harr; server controllers: we have a server side 'chat' controller but each chat message is
    going to have to be handled client side by the appropriate state's controller (e.g. lobby, game). Unless we
    can just have a permanently listening ChatController? One to ponder.</p>

    <p>Worked out a reasonable definition of server side view stats this evening too: they should contain
    <strong>only</strong> static data, e.g. wrapping content or data which is always present. Obvious really,
    but not a definitive line in the sand I'd drawn until yet.</p>

    <h2>Sunday 6th May, 2012</h2>

    <p>Had some travel time today to think about a couple of areas:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Client side views</li>
        <li>Security</li>
    </ul>

    <p>&hellip;but more about them later.</p>

    <h2>Saturday 5th May, 2012 (#2)</h2>

    <p>Twitter's <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/anywhere/welcome">Anywhere</a>
    stuff is actually a lot better than I'd given it credit for. Given that the entire game is reliant
    on JS and there are no real page loads, the JS only twitter auth route is perfectly acceptable.</p>

    <p>Current mechanism is very simple - use the standard Twitter Anywhere JS handlers and emit
    a message to the server upon successful auth, or if user's already authed. Server simply
    checks if this user exists in the DB or not, creates it if so, and returns pretty much the same
    data back to the user after setting the user against the socket.</p>

    <p><b>TODO</b> need to verify the _identity attribute as per twitter's recommendations.</p>

    <p>Got very basic scoring mechanism in. Started audio.</p>

    <p>Next on the list is to start thinking about user object representation. We have a server side
    model which ideally we'd reuse in some capacity on the client side but this is where isomorphic
    code feels difficult. Naturally there are certain things the server side model cares about which
    are of no interest to the client (e.g. DB persistence) and similarly things the client wants to
    track which don't benefit the server (e.g. current user mouse/cursor coordinates). Not sure how
    to solve this.</p>

    <h2>Saturday 5th May, 2012 (#1)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Reworked directory structure to get rid of pointless server/app/ namespace</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Need to start looking at Twitter Oauth. Anxious about how this is going to work for a number
    of reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>None of the node oauth modules I've used before have worked very well - user has always been
        asked to re-auth the app every time</li>
        <li>It doesn't fit into the flow of the rest of the site - URLs instead of WebSockets etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Current plan is to try and do it all in a JS popup (can't do ajax / iframe because of Twitter's
    restrictions around that). Hopefully we can auth then call a JS method in the parent which will
    trigger a WebSockets message to the server to get the authed details. Might look at Twitter's own
    JS auth stuff too.</p>

    <h2>Friday 4th May, 2012</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>First real effort to get concept of proper game and tile models in</li>
        <li>Games now created properly, messages are restricted to the correct game room</li>
        <li>Users can now choose whether to create a new game or join existing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Moved pretty much all tile flipping logic to the server. Theory had been to let clients
    run their own game logic and have the server ratify any requests (e.g. is it time for another tile?)
    but this simply won't work in reality. The appeal is obvious - let the server detach itself from
    'game loop' style events as far as possible, but it doesn't scale well when dealing with more than
    2 player games - in a 10+ player scenario you'll end up with 10 different clients running their own
    version of events and just bombarding the server anyway.</p>
    
    <p>Turns out that moving the tile flip logic isn't so bad anyway. The relevant setTimeout calls are 
    all nicely abstracted behind the Game and tile models, meaning they're properly self contained and
    at least don't <i>look</i> ugly in the main server logic.</p>

    <p>Started using <a href="http://mongoosejs.com/">mongoose</a> for Model &rarr; MongoDB persistence.
    Seems decent but not quite sure I'm using it particularly well - my models need to do a lot of work
    which never has to go near the DB (create tiles, manage tile flips, tile hits etc), so at the moment
    each model simply has a namespaced 'model' property which is its mongoose object. Doesn't feel great.</p>

    <p>One thing I'm still unsure how to do correctly in node-land is sharing in-memory objects between
    controllers. Both the Game and Lobby controllers need to know about the list of active games, which
    is crudely held in an 'activeGames' object inside a StateManager object. This object feels like a bit
    of a catch all / global cop out, but not sure how else to solve that yet.</p>
